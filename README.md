During the development of advanced search filters, I have created a system that enables dynamic property updates along with changes. This system efficiently handles the introduction and acceptance of changes in dependencies between them, while also avoiding undesired reactions with filters with which it should not interact.
The example below clearly demonstrates that when a model is selected in the filters, it should not remain active when the brand changes or ceases to exist.
